## What is NetshGuard?

NetshGuard is a Web Application Firewall which specially designed to work in OSI Layer 7 by intercepting all incoming and outgoing HTTP request to filter possibility of SQL Injection, Remote Code Execution (RCE), Local File Inclusion (LFI) / Remote File Inclusion (RFI) and Cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. We also provide a semi-protection for OSI Layer 7 DDOS by limiting number of TCP connection can be made by an IP Address.

Everything is connected to LINE Messenger API to make sure the site owner have a full control to the Web Application Firewall protection, even without touching their PC. We even provide a one-click-total-lock-down solution, so the owner can put the site into maintenance mode just by sending One Time Password (OTP) key to our LINE chatter-bot.
